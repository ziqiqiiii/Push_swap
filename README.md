# Push_swap

One of the 42cursus projects.
Push_swap is a program that sort a set of numbers to increasing order.


This project care more about the numbers of operations being executed instead of like normal sorting algorithm which care more about the runtime.
We are required to code out an algorithm that fulfilled numbers of operations depends on the number of input.

exp = 
3 inputs <= 2 instructions,
5 inputs <= 12 instructions,
100 inputs <= 1500,
500 inputs <= 11500.
